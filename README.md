# TicTacToe in Java

## Overview
In order to introduce myself to Java I created TicTacToe in Java. While completing this project I couldn't help but notice how similar Java and C# are. This program has three different classes. The main class that runs the program, a Board class that contains an array to store board info, and functions to print the board and display winners. The Player class contains the code to determine if you want to play against an AI, take your turn, and switch players.

## Development Environment
* IntelliJ IDEA: An IDE that includes all necessary tools to run Java
* JDK 17: Development kit that allows you to create Java applications

## Useful Websites
* [W3 Java Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)
* [Java T Point](https://www.javatpoint.com/)

## Future Work
* Improve robustness of user input. It is very easy to crash program with invalid input
* Improve display. Maybe make it so numbers only appear the first time it displays?
* Improve AI. Right now it just selects a random number
* Add column, row, and diagonal arrays to determine if someone is close to winning.
